General remarks
---------------

The present implementation can only handle square input images.

Development of this 'computational engine' benefitted from the 
availabilty of Matlab routines by Helgeson et al.[2] and the tutorial
paper[3] and code[4] on DDM by Germain et al.

CHANGELOG (for this module)
---------------------------

210208
    - implemented two alternative ImageStructureEngine classes.
    
      ImageStructureEngine2 puts all FFTs to be calculated into a single
      stack, and then does all FFTs using a single call. This will facilitate
      interfacing with CUDA or FFTW. 
      This alternative engine is promising for simple CUDA/FFTW speed up.
      **HELP NEEDED**
      
      ImageStructureEngine3 greatly reduces the number of individual
      FFTs to be calculated, by using linearity of FFT and storing FFTs already
      calculated. "Only" 50% perfomance boost observed; the subsequent complex
      arithmetic (substracting, abs value) is probably heavy as well.
      I could imagine that the algorithm might run entirely on
      a GPU, with all buffering and operations taking place directly on GPU.
      **HELP NEEDED**

200424
    - change variable names: qx and qy become ux and uy (to avoid
      confusion with existing literature, factor 2 pi)
    - qx, qy and q re-introduced in the ImageStructureFunction,
      derived from ux and uy: qx = 2*np.pi*ux, qy = 2*np.pi*uy

200213
    - add ISFstep parameter, enabling to calculate ISF only at specific
      lag times, while still using all available data to calculate ISF
      at those points. This is better than using 'skip' which simply
      throws away intermediate frames

200122
    - integrated this module as 'ddm' into 'ddm_toolkit'
    - code and syntax clean-up (unfinished)
    - new functional, intermediate version requiring further
      maintenance in near future!   

190716
    - added Blackman-Harris apodization as suggested by 
      Giavazzi et al.[5]

190206
    - further clean-up
    - include pre-averager/image picker for multitau
    
190130 
    - back to basics, restructure code
    - separated out and removed analysis functions (analysis should be
      done afterwards, elsewhere)

180730 
    - initial working DDM code

class ImageStructureEngine(ImageStructureEngineBase):

    This engine processes an arbitrarily long sequence of images, using
    the minimal amount of memory for calculating the ISF, averaging
    the ISF over many images, if the sequence length permits.
    
    The entire calculation is carried out in pixel-frame units, i.e.
    time lags are in numbers of frames, the Fourier transforms give
    'inverse pixel' frequencies. Book-keeping concerning the conversion
    to real world units (viz. Âµm/pixel and s/frame) should be done
    elsewhere.
    
    Instantiation of the class prepares a ImageStructureEngine for 
    receiving and processing an image sequence. Several of these engines
    can be created 'in parallel', having different processing options.
    
    This is the original version, without any optimizations of the calculations.
    It is the 'tried and tested' reference version.
    Any optimizations should be implemented in other subclasses
    of ImageStructureEngineBase.

    Instantiation
    -------------
    ise = ImageStructureEngine(
        Npx, Nbuf,  ISFstep = 1, apodization = 'No',
        pick = 1, avg = 1, drop = 0, fillbuf = True,
        dummyrun = False
        )
        
    Parameters
    ----------
    Npx : int
        Number of pixel of each frame of input; must be a positive
        multiple of 2 
    Nbuf : int
        Buffer size, number of time lags of the ISF that will be
        calculated; any positive non-zero integer
    ISFstep : int: step-size that defines which lag times of the ISF in
        the buffer will be calculated. Default = 1 which means that all
        lag times will be calculated. ISFstep = 10 will only calculate
        the ISF at lags 0, 10, 20... Nbuf, the other ISF lags will be
        zero. This is different from the 'pick' parameter (see 'Low-level'
        parameters below), since the frames actually do fill up the FIFO
        frame buffer, and contribute to the calculation of the ISF at 
        some point in the sequence. This gives better ISFs at long times,
        at the expense of memory usage, but does avoid long calculation
        times by only calculating some time lags.
        #TODO propose a logarithmic scale step-size! => we should make
        a new parameter that is just a list of the taufs for which the ISF
        is actually calculated. This will also change the structure of
        ISFaccum.
    apodization : str : 'No' or 'Blackman-Harris'
        If not 'No', a 2D Blackman-Harris window will be applied to
        the incoming image before further processing
        
    Low-level tweak parameters
    --------------------------
    pick : int (optional)
        Pick only every Npick-th image for processing into the FIFO 
        image buffer. The lag times will then be spaced by Npick. The
        ISF will cover lags 0 until Npick*Nbuf
    avg : int (optional)
        Instead of picking one image, take the average over Navg
        subsequent images. Allowed values: 1...Npick. 
    drop : int (optional)
        Before actually starting the engine, drop Ndrop images. This is
        intended for centering the picking by one engine around the
        averaging-picking by another engine.
    fillbuf : bool (future parameter, not fully implemented)
        Normally (fillbuf == True) the ISF calculation buffer will
        first be filled BEFORE any ISF is calculated. This way, all lag
        times of the ISF will be calculated over the same number of 
        image pairs. NOT IMPLEMENTED YET: fillbuf==False, in which case 
        ISFs would be calculated for those lags that are already in the
        buffer.
        
    Attributes
    ----------
    tau : int
        Lag times of the ISF (in frame units).
    ux, uy : float
        Spatial frequency coordinates in x and y direction of the 2D FFT.
        These are in 'inverse pixel' units. They are not the
        "radial pixel frequency" q
            q = 2 * np.pi * u
        Spatial sample distance is always 1.0 pixel
    ISFcount : int
        Number of frames over which the total ISF has been
        accumulated. (This is a single int value for fillbuf == True,
        but would be a vector for fillbuf == False)
    (to be continued)
        
    Remarks
    -------
    All calculations are done in floating point. (BUFTYPE = np.float).
    Incoming images are converted to floating point.
    
    Only averaging is implemented, since summing of images was found
    to be not useful. The averages are calculated in floating point.
